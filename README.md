# Simon_game
The Simon game is a classic memory game featuring four colored buttons that light up and produce tones in a sequence. Players must repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons. As the game progresses, the sequence gets longer, testing players' memory and concentration skills. It was invented in 1978 and became hugely popular.
